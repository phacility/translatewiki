For information on configuring Phabricator, see **[[ %s | Configuring Inbound Email ]]**.\n\nIn most cases, you can reply to email you receive from Phabricator to leave comments. You can also use **mail commands** to take a greater range of actions (like claiming a task or requesting changes to a revision) without needing to log in to the web UI.\n\nMail commands are keywords which start with an exclamation point, like `!claim`. Some commands may take parameters, like `!assign alincoln`.\n\nTo use mail commands, write one command per line at the beginning or end of your mail message. For example, you could write this in a reply to task email to claim the task:\n\n```\n!claim\n\nI'll take care of this.\n```\n\n\nWhen Phabricator receives your mail, it will process any commands first, then post the remaining message body as a comment. You can execute multiple commands at once:\n\n```\n!assign alincoln\n!close\n\nI just talked to @alincoln, and he showed me that he fixed this.\n```\n",
