This will record the build result, and continue the next step in the build if the build was waiting for a result.\n\nWhen you send a status message about a build target, you can optionally include detailed `lint` or `unit` results alongside the message. See below for details.\n\nIf you want to report intermediate results but a build hasn't completed yet, you can use the `work` message. This message doesn't have any direct effects, but allows you to send additional data to update the progress of the build target. The target will continue waiting for a completion message, but the UI will update to show the progress which has been made.\n\nMessage Types\n=============\nWhen you send Harbormaster a message, you must include a `type`, which describes the overall state of the build. For example, use `pass` to tell Harbomaster that a build completed successfully.\n\nSupported message types are:\n\n$1\n\nUnit Results\n============\nYou can report test results alongside a message. The simplest way to do this is to report all the results alongside a `pass` or `fail` message, but you can also send a `work` message to report intermediate results.\n\nTo provide unit test results, pass a list of results in the `unit` parameter. Each result shoud be a dictionary with these keys:\n\n$2\n\nThe `result` parameter recognizes these test results:\n\n$3\n\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `unit` parameter. It reports one passing test and one failing test:\n\n\n\n```lang=json\n$4```\n\nLint Results\n============\nLike unit test results, you can report lint results alongside a message. The `lint` parameter should contain results as a list of dictionaries with these keys:\n\n$5\n\nThe `severity` parameter recognizes these severity levels:\n\n$6\n\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `lint` parameter. It reports one error and one warning:\n\n```lang=json\n$7```\n\n",
